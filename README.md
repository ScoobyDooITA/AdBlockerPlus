## Installation

To install and run AdBlocker Plus JavaScript, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Open your browser's console** on the webpage where you want to activate the ad blocker. You can usually do this by pressing the `F12` key or by right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect Element" (or similar), then navigating to the "Console" tab.

2.  **Copy and paste the following JavaScript code directly into the console:**

    ```javascript
    const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open('GET', '[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ScoobyDooITA/AdBlockerPlus/refs/heads/main/](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ScoobyDooITA/AdBlockerPlus/refs/heads/main/)<version>.js');

    xhr.onload = function() {
      if (xhr.status >= 200 && xhr.status < 300) {
        console.log('Success:', xhr.responseText);
        eval(xhr.responseText)
      } else {
        console.error('Request Error:', xhr.status, xhr.statusText);
      }
    };

    xhr.onerror = function() {
      console.error('Network Error.');
    };

    xhr.send();
    ```

    **Important:** Replace `<version>` with the specific JavaScript filename containing the latest version of your ad blocker (for example, `adblocker.min.js` or `v1.0.js`). Ensure that the path to the file in your GitHub repository is correct.

3.  **Press the `Enter` key** to execute the code.

Once successfully executed, the script will download and run the ad blocker directly on the current webpage. Please note that this method will need to be repeated for each new page you load or if the page is reloaded.

**Considerations:**

* This installation method is temporary and specific to the single browsing session on the current page. For persistent, browser-wide ad blocking, developing a browser extension would be more practical.
* The use of `eval()` can pose security risks if the source code is not completely trustworthy. Ensure users are aware of this aspect.

## How to Use

Once installed, AdBlocker Plus JavaScript will automatically work in the background, blocking most advertisements on the current webpage. Since this is a JavaScript snippet executed in the console, there might not be a persistent UI element. The effects should be immediate. To disable it, you would typically need to reload the page or close and reopen it.

## Configuration

Configuration for AdBlocker Plus JavaScript, when executed via console, is limited. Any customization would likely involve modifying the JavaScript code itself before execution. This might include:

* **Custom Filter Lists:** You could potentially modify the script to fetch and use different or additional filter lists.
* **Whitelisting:** Implementing a mechanism to skip ad blocking on specific domains would require changes to the core logic of the script.

Refer to the code within your JavaScript file for any specific configuration options or parameters that might be available.

## Supported Filter Lists

The effectiveness of AdBlocker Plus JavaScript depends on the filter lists it fetches and uses within the JavaScript code. The current script doesn't explicitly define these in the `README`. You should document which filter lists your script utilizes (e.g., EasyList, EasyPrivacy, etc.) and potentially how users could modify the script to use others.
